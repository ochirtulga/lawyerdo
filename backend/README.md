# MWA - Homework 07 - Mongodb 01
## Coding Exercise
Create a new DB called `homework07` (Local or DaaS) and connect to it from an Express app.
Using the same source code from `Homework06`, update your Restful API with real DB CRUD operations.
* Implement a new route (`GET /search/:q`) to search by student's name if it matches the passed `:q` parameter, send the results as JSON.  
### Notes
* Test your API using your preferrable REST Client (No UI is needed).  
* Push your code to Github (without `node_modules` dependencies).
